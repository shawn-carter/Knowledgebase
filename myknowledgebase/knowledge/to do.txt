We could enhance the Search by giving the user the ability to search for author=sc3639&tags=html - or is this going too far?  We could put tick boxes or a radio button next to search to filter: Search All, Search Title & Body, Search Author, Search Tags
My Articles is a simple view, it only shows the Title, Extract and Edit button... we could enhance it.
We mentioned about superusers being able to edit articles that are softdeleted, but the view currently redirect them and shows a warning that the article cannot be editted.
