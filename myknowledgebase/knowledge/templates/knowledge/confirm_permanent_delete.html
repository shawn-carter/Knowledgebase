<h2>Confirm Permanent Deletion</h2>
<p>
    You are about to permanently delete the article titled: <strong>{{ article.title }}</strong>. This action cannot be
    undone and will also remove all associated audit logs.
</p>
<p>I have added the permanent delete functionality to demonstrate that it can be done, but ideally articles should only
    be soft deleted</p>
