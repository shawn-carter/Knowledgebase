We could enhance the Search by giving the user the ability to search for author=sc3639&tags=html - or is this going too far?  We could put tick boxes or a radio button next to search to filter: Search All, Search Title & Body, Search Author, Search Tags
My Articles is a simple view, it only shows the Title, Extract and Edit button... we could enhance it.
